* installation

** developer

Install the [[https://pixi.sh/][pixi language manager]] for your system

Then, clone this repo or your own fork
: cd ~/src
: git clone https://github.com/<pmiam-or-your-user>/team-10.git
: cd team-10

Generate your own project environment from the included =pixi.lock=
: pixi install

Use pixi to run programs in the development environment e.g.
: pixi run python
(optional) direnv users can activate the environment by running
: direnv allow
This essentially links your shell's python command to the correct env

To add or change dependencies for your feature, use the commands
: pixi add <conda-dep>
: pixi add --pypi <pypi-dep>
